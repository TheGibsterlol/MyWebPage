                Things I like:
            <p>
                  I like many things such as dogs, food, sports, and music. I like my dog and every other dogs because they are fun to walk and play with. The kind of food I prefer is typically Mexican food because I like spicy things. I enjoy all sports but mainly soccer and football. Finally, the music I like is Jazz and Opera.

                    Favorite Food Chorizo con Queso
                <p>
                    My favoirte food of all time is called chorizo con queso. It is literally what it means: chorizo with cheese. Chorizo. For those who don't know, is a type of sausage that is usually ground up and put into different dishes. This dish however is simple and amazing because you just mix melted cheese (I only like melted cheese), with chorizo and put it in the oven until it get crispy. Then, you take homemade tortillas and make tacos out of them. It's a bit messy, but it's the best of the best.
